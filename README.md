Disease diagnosis is critical for planning appropriate therapy and guaranteeing patients' well-being. Because analysing medical information is a difficult and intellectually taxing endeavour, human error impedes proper diagnosis. The use of artificial intelligence (AI) can increase diagnostic accuracy and efficiency. While current research has studied numerous techniques to detecting various diseases, an overview of sectors in which AI has been used, including their efficacy in identifying emergent digitalized healthcare services, has not yet been effectively achieved. We depict the AI landscape in diagnostics and give a glimpse to guide future research by undertaking a critical evaluation. This paper contributes to academia by recommending a research agenda. Practitioners comprehend how far AI has progressed. Practitioners are aware of how AI improves diagnoses and how it promotes healthcare. However, various challenges must be overcome before AI may be successfully applied in illness diagnoses.
